Our Smart Buildings and Cities course is wrapping up this week with student project presentation. The breadth of the topics (see image) shows the breadth of applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence in Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering.\
\
The projects go through the typical workflow of problem definition, data sourcing, data preprocessing, model selection, training, cross-validation and evaluation, which will more and more become a standard workflow in the toolbox of any ACE engineers. This is complemented with case studies on smart buildings, data visualization and critical thinking.
