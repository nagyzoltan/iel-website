Check out Ting-Yu Dai's amazing work!

In the workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning, he presented “CityTFT: Temporal Fusion Transformer for Urban Building Energy Modeling” and explore the use of Transformer models in urban energy modeling. 🏙️

🚀 Key Contributions:

• Derived from TFT, a Transformer-based forecasting model, to capture the unseen weather dynamics.

• A customized probabilistic loss function to improve the load prediction.
