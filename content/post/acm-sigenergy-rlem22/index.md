RLEM'22 â€” The workshop on Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management in Buildings and Cities â€”  was held on November 11, 2022 in conjunction with ACM BuildSys'22 in hybrid mode (in Boston and virtually). 

See the recording on YouTube: <https://youtu.be/u3g1HxZwh_s>

We had a great program with two keynotes ðŸ”‘â™«ðŸŽµ - 

Troy Harvey, CEO, PassiveLogic \

Gregor Henze, Professor, University of Colorado Boulder\
Opportunities and Challenges of Building Energy Management using Advanced Building Controls 

And awesome technical talks ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ 

ðŸ‘‰ Behavioural Cloning based RL Agents for District Energy Management 

ðŸ‘‰ Deep Reinforcement Learning-based SOH-aware Battery Management for DER Aggregation 

ðŸ‘‰ Deep Reinforcement Learning with Online Data Augmentation to Improve Sample Efficiency for Intelligent HVAC Control 

ðŸ‘‰ B2RL: An open-source dataset for building batch reinforcement learning 

ðŸ‘‰ComfortLearn: Enabling agent-based occupant-centric building controls
