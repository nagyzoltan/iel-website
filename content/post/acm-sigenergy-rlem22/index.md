RLEM22 — The workshop on Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management in Buildings and Cities —  was held on November 11, 2022 in conjunction with ACM BuildSys'22 in hybrid mode (in Boston and virtually). 

See the recording on YouTube: <https://youtu.be/u3g1HxZwh_s>

We had a great program with two keynotes

Troy Harvey, CEO, PassiveLogic \
Architecting a Path Toward Generalized Autonomy: Addressing the Biggest Opportunity in Decarbonization 

Gregor Henze, Professor, University of Colorado Boulder\
Opportunities and Challenges of Building Energy Management using Advanced Building Controls 

And awesome technical talks 

* Behavioural Cloning based RL Agents for District Energy Management 
* Deep Reinforcement Learning-based SOH-aware Battery Management for DER Aggregation 
* Deep Reinforcement Learning with Online Data Augmentation to Improve Sample Efficiency for Intelligent HVAC Control 
* B2RL: An open-source dataset for building batch reinforcement learning 
* ComfortLearn: Enabling agent-based occupant-centric building controls
