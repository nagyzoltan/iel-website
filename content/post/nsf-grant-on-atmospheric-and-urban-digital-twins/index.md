We received a grant from the National Science foundation to organize a Workshop and develop a white paper on Atmospheric and Urban Digital Twins (AUDT).

The workshop will be organized as a series of focused group meetings, invited talks, virtual meetings, and a talk at a major conference. The objectives of the workshop are to develop clear definitions and requirements of AUDT, develop exemplary AUDT demonstrators, and support in channeling the different digital twin developments for weather and climate studies.
