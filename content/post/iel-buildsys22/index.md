⁉️How can we use past data to generate synthetic data to improve our learning controllers 🤨? \
\
‼️Check our our paper led by Marta Fochesato ([ETH Zürich](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eth-zurich/)) and Fazel Khayatian ([Empa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/empa/)) at ACM BuildSys'22 tomorrow (Nov 10).\
\
Marta implements a TimeGAN approach in CityLearn and demonstrates the improvement of the control performance.\
