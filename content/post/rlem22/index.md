And that's a wrap for [\#RLEM22](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=rlem22&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6997004333284286464) [\#BuildSys22](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=buildsys22&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6997004333284286464) ! We had a great workshop with around 40 participants from all over the world on the challenges and opportunities of building controls.  \

We had inspiring conversations with [Troy Harvey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAdZYQwB9LHq6cw5Ai8V_OG-aMPcnpp8IrA) and Gregor Henze on where the bottlenecks are for advanced building automation are, complimented by visionary outlooks on what the future holds, and how we could get there.\
\
The technical presentations pushed the limits from occupant comfort datasets, battery control, online data augmentation, building benchmark datasets, to controlling multiple buildings.\
