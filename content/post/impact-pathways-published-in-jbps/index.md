In a great collaboration between Schools of Architecture, Policy and Engineering we present IMPACT Pathways, a bottom-up model with residence level granularity to estimate carbon emission pathways in cities under the impact of climate change, urban planning/development, technology adoption and grid decarbonization. 



We evaluate for a case study in Austin, TX. Some key findings:

\- the need to include long-term climate change forecasts for energy demand estimation

\- short-term emission reductions can be cancelled out by long-term developments

\- one positive decarbonization mechanism (eg grid decarbonization) can be overturned by another one (eg urban development)

\- several decarbonization scenarios can produce similar short-term results, but differ in the longer term



Great leadership by Juliana Felkner, with team members Varun Rai, Ariane Beck, D. Cale Reeves, Ph.D. and many more
