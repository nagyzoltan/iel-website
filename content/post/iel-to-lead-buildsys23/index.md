Dr Nagy has been elected to be the General Chair fo ACM BuildSys'23. The TPC Chairs are [Rajesh Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAACssQwBoGHJ554KTh-8P4UTtyXXSbQWqDw) and [Clayton Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAEEmw0B1rFk3hcjq9HUl3iebkPg8lJtCTs). We look forward to receiving your awesome research papers, posters and demos in the area of intelligent sustainable infrastructure systems.

BuildSys is a highly selective, single track forum for researchers and practitioners working on systems' issues for energy-efficient buildings, cities, and transportation driven by networked sensing, computing, and control functions. As such, BuildSys's scope encompasses all systems within the urban fabric, including not only buildings, but also transportation and other critical infrastructure systems that will make up smart cities of the future. BuildSys provides an ideal convergence venue for researchers across different disciplines addressing challenges facing the design, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems.
