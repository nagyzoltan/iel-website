🌍 Buildings and transportation combined account for a staggering 70% of global energy consumption. Yet, they present massive CO2 mitigation potential through smart electrification, efficient energy usage, and upgrade of thermal properties. We believe that integrating renewable energy systems, photovoltaics, solar-thermal collectors, storage, and electric vehicles holds the key to unlock this potential.\
\
💡 But integration must be done carefully and intelligently. Here's where AI and RL come into play. They've shown human expert level performance in various domains, and we think they have the power to orchestrate the complexities of smart cities.\
\
🎯 Topics of interest include:\
Challenges & opportunities for AI/RL in Building and Cities\
Comparisons ofAI/RL algorithms to other control solutions\
Frameworks and datasets for benchmarking algorithms\
Theoretical contributions to the RL field\
Applications like demand response, HVAC control, traffic scheduling, etc.\
Predicting energy consumption & renewable energy forecasting for Energy Demand Site Management\
