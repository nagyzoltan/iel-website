ðŸ‘‹ We had an amazing hashtag#RLEM23 Workshop at hashtag#BuildSys23. 



John Sipple and Bharathan Balaji gave two great keynotes on practical challenges and implementations of RL controllers in real buildings.



The two paper sessions focused on real-world implementations as well as fast building emulators/simulators for training. The papers are available on the ACM Digital Library: https://lnkd.in/gcw22SJg



The recording of the Workshop is here: https://lnkd.in/gqNUEA29
