Machine learning seems to be everywhere these days. But how does it perform in predicting indoor air quality or sleep quality in individuals? Our new paper led by [Hagen Fritz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABXP5OABlGjRkh0zfaRkoVxGEnNbOPNnASI) and [Mengjia Tang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABqF-5UBPOaQsKtMWsyyFq0wqaIU0MHrEaM) explores common algorithms and their performance for this task.\
