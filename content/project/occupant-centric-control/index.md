title: Occupant-Centric Control

summary: >-
  An ideal controller should adapt itself to the preferences of the occupant and
  the environmental conditions. We developed LightLearn and HVACLearn, which are
  occupant centric controller (OCC) for lighting and HVAC, respectively, based
  on Reinforcement Learning (RL). 


  Both can successfully balance occupant comfort and energy consumption. The adaptive nature of LightLearn/HVACLearn suggests that reinforcement learning based occupant centered control is a viable approach to mitigate the discrepancy between occupant comfort and the goals of building control.
