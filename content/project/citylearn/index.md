summary: "CityLearn is an open source OpenAI Gym environment for the
  implementation of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) for building energy
  coordination and demand response in cities. Its objective is to facilitiate
  and standardize the evaluation of RL agents such that different algorithms can
  be easily compared with each other. Try it out using
  our [example](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oxdAMLTRA1qsLuwJbd5oo9y\
  EmSjm6i64?usp=sharing) in Google Colab! More details and installation on

Districts and cities have periods of high demand for electricity, which raise electricity prices and the overall cost of the power distribution networks. Flattening, smoothening, and reducing the overall curve of electrical demand helps reduce operational and capital costs of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution networks. Demand response is the coordination of electricity consuming agents (i.e. buildings) in order to reshape the overall curve of electrical demand. CityLearn allows the easy implementation of reinforcement learning agents in a multi-agent setting to reshape their aggregated curve of electrical demand by controlling the storage of energy by every agent. Currently, CityLearn allows controlling the storage of domestic hot water (DHW), and chilled water (for sensible cooling and dehumidification). CityLearn also includes models of air-to-water heat pumps, electric heaters, solar photovoltaic arrays, and the pre-computed energy loads of the buildings, which include space cooling, dehumidification, appliances, DHW, and solar generation.
