HVAC systems account for a significant portion of building energy use. Nighttime setback scheduling is an [Energy Conservation Measure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/energy-conservation-measure "Learn more about Energy Conservation Measure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (ECM) where cooling and heating [setpoints](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/setpoints "Learn more about setpoints from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") are increased and decreased respectively during unoccupied periods with the goal of obtaining energy savings. However, knowledge of a building’s real occupancy is required to maximize the success of this measure. In addition, there is the need for a scalable way to estimate energy savings potential from ECMs that is not limited by building specific parameters and experimental or simulation modeling investments. Here, we propose MARTINI, a sMARt meTer drIveN estImation of occupant-derived Heating, Ventilation and [Air Conditioning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/air-conditioning "Learn more about Air Conditioning from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")(HVAC) schedules and energy savings that leverages the ubiquity of energy smart meters and Wi-Fi infrastructure in [commercial buildings](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/commercial-building "Learn more about commercial buildings from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). We estimate the schedules by clustering Wi-Fi derived occupancy profiles and, estimate energy savings by shifting ramp-up and setback times observed in typical operational/static load profiles that are obtained by clustering smart meter energy profiles. Our case-study results with five buildings over seven months show an average of 8.1%–10.8% (summer) and 0.2%–5.9% (fall) chilled water energy savings when HVAC system operation is aligned with occupancy. We validate our method with results from [Building Energy Performance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/building-energy-performance "Learn more about Building Energy Performance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") Simulation (BEPS) and find that estimated average savings of MARTINI are within 0.9%–2.4% of the BEPS predictions. In the absence of occupancy information, we can still estimate potential savings from increasing ramp-up time and decreasing setback start time. In 51 academic buildings, we find savings potentials between 1%–5%.
