I am a PhD student with research interests in occupant-centric control of HVAC systems, energy flexibility of Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings and the use of reinforcement learning for building energy systems control towards building electrification and decarbonization.

You might find me building LEGOs or weightlifting when I convince myself that I have nothing left on my Trello board.
